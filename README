This module provides an easy way to interactively run PowerShell
commands from a perl script in a persistent shell environment.
This allows you to connect to remote services such as Office365
hosted Exchange and execute commands on demand rather than having
to shell out for each one of them and wait for the 10+ second
remote session startup overhead.

This module only runs on Windows environments. (I was late to the
party to find out that PowerShell for Linux exists)  On a Linux
system most of the problems solved by this module aren't problems.

The documentation can be viewed at:
  https://metacpan.org/pod/Win32::PowerShell::IPC

The module is easiest installed via CPAN:
  cpanm Win32::PowerShell::IPC

but to install from this source, use
  dzil build
  cd Win32-PowerShell-IPC-$VERSION/
  perl Makefile.PL
  make install

and if you don't have Dist::Zilla yet, you can install via
  cpanm Dist::Zilla
  cpanm `dzil authordeps`
